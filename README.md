An Automated Optical Character Recognition of Handwritten English Letters using Decision Trees & Random Forests.

An Automated Optical Character Recognition of Handwritten English Letters using Decision Trees & Random Forests. This project involves predicting the drawn letter in a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Decision Trees & Random Forests. Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is employed to automatically convert images of handwritten English letters into machine-encoded text. The GUI allows users to draw a letter, and the system predicts the corresponding letter using decision trees and random forests.

Supported with a simple GUI:
